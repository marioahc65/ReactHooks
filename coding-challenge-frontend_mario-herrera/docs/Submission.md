# Submission Notes

I approached the problem, first analyzing which was the real problem and what the client wanted. Then, I searched for which coding paradigms could be better for this project, choosing SOLID and Atomic.
One reason for the technical decision that I took about libraries was to try not to mix types of UI(Semantic, Antd). So I try to adapt what the client gifts me but always add a little more than they told me. If this was a real project, I would use typeScript and maybe use new things such as Micro Frond Ends. But this is new implementation needs time. And I would give more time to finish the projects. 
Well, first I feel that my project is not finished. I would add more things. For example, when you go back, your filter will continue with more CSS and try to use Memos.
I didn't get any stuck or blocker. 
If you need more information let me know and I will help you with everything
